# DeDLOC-GPT

DeDLOC-GPT is an LLM trained using [DeDLOC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10207.pdf).


## Vision for DeDLOC-GPT

We want DeDLOC-GPT to be a source of open collaboration where models can be trained more cheaply and anyone can contribute to the model. We can then provide access to this model to the public, which is something that the open source community has not done yet.

Once we get more collaborators than OpenAI, it's only a matter of time before our model is better.


## Implementation

We want to start off where others have left off. Training an LLM using [DeDLOC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10207.pdf). The [article](https://huggingface.co/blog/collaborative-training) provides a nice summary and the [code](https://github.com/yandex-research/DeDLOC) is on GitHub.



We want to start off with a good model. We can look at [Hugging Face's LLM leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) to find the best open source model.



## Work to do

1. Train an LLM using the DeDLOC code and methods.
2. Create a web app to query the trained AI.
3. Set up a model verification/ethicality pipeline.
4. Contact experts and volunteers.
5. Work to make DeDLOC-GPT competitive with ChatGPT.
6. Monetize the system.
7. Decentralize the AI querying.
